The IDE allows viewing the camera&apos;s frame buffer, accessing sensor controls, uploading scripts to the camera via serial over USB (or WiFi/BLE if available) and includes a set of image processing tools to generate tags, thresholds, keypoints etc...\r\n\r\nThe OpenMV project is a THP semifinalist and was successfully funded via Kickstarter back in 2015 and has come a long way since then.",

It displays applications so that you can check the weather and local news while you are getting ready in the morning. It&apos;s also modular, so you can easy move it around or hang it on the wall if you like.  We&apos;ve created a basic application that you can run on the mirror, but it&apos;s totally customizable if you want to write some of your own code. \r\n\r\nIn the future, we plan to add AI components to make this fully automated. We are drawing inspiration from this project:  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc9UbREmo58\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc9UbREmo58</a>. Stay tuned for a future video about that!",

Although there are third-party transceiver modules and data loggers on the market, they are too expensive and complicated to deploy in volume.\r\n\r\nLoFi is a very low cost ($5), small, auto-transmitting module. All you need to do is to attach the modules to interesting appliance circuit points or sensors throughout your home and garden. The data arrives on your PC or can be sent to the Internet with a WiFi hotspot.\r\n\r\nNo programming, no protocols to learn, and no carrier boards for you to make. Just attach!\r\n\r\nUsing your desktop or laptop, you can set trigger levels on individual modules to tell them when to transmit. For example, send an update when the voltage changes by more than 1 V on the vibration sensor near the garage door opener. You can also set the module on a timer, such as hourly on your garden monitor.\r\n\r\nThe possibilities are endless!",

Unfortunately the cost of industrial servos is prohibitive to the individual maker (thousands of dollars per motor).\r\n\r\nWe&apos;ve been developing an affordable open-source industrial servo motor, opening the door to sophisticated mechatronics applications.  Our design leverages the low cost of mass produced stepper motors.  We are able to achieve very high resolution via 14b encoder feedback (after calibration routine!).

Almost all DIY projects from 3D printers and CNC mills, to air hockey and juggling robots use them. However in industrial automation, brushless servomotors have taken over, and it&apos;s clear why: They don&apos;t lose steps, are much more powerful, efficient, and silent.\r\n\r\nHowever, brushless motors are not unique to expensive industrial automation equipment. In fact, you can get some very powerful and cheap motors at hobby shops. The electronics to drive these motors are also dirt cheap. So how come virtually no non-industrial automation systems use them?\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I have no idea. Seriously, a driver that allows this should clearly exist.\r\nBut since it didn&apos;t, I decided to make one.\r\n\r\nAnd you are invited!\r\nThis project is open source, both in hardware and software, and I warmly welcome anyone who wants to join.",

DSI is mostly used in mobile devices (smartphones & tablets).\r\n\r\nI started this project as the base for building a low-cost HD projector. Later on I realized it could be also useful for VR applications and as a general-purpose graphics card for small uCs - that's why it comes in Arduino shield format.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

They might be tethered to ethernet, or have poor wireless range, or can't be battery powered.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to provide all the information others would need to integrate wireless Arduino nodes into a full-featured home automation system, with polished Android/iPhone apps as well as browser-based user interface.  In addition, the automation gateway can historize and chart sensor data, react to sensor values (send emails, do android push or iphone prowl notification, etc...), as well as control existing commercial products you may already own (Sonos speakers, WEMO, Insteon, z-wave devices).\r\n\r\nI've made the design as flexible as I know how.  This project is an enabler, by extensibly connecting two great open source platforms:  Arduino & OpenHAB.",

            "description": "I wanted to do something interesting with my RPi and a 2.4\" TFT LCD. Google Glass was hot in the news, so I've decided to hack something similar. The semi-transparent mirror was extracted from Eye of Horus Beamsplitter, and the projection lens is cut from a plastic 3x Fresnel magnifying lens. The box and mounting parts are 3D-printed from ABS. Head strap is for GoPro. One RPi USB port is used for WiFi, and second for 2.4Ghz small wireless keyboard/mouse combo. All together cost around 100$. I haven't figured out a good option for the power supply yet, and don't know if this thing can have a practical application. The display driver is fbtft framebuffer, so both text and (non-accelerated) graphical modes are possible, but with 320x240 resolution using X is not too exciting. Display brightness is sufficient if ambient light is not too bright.\r\n\r\nHere is a demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCYnIHqwIJU",

There&apos;s a programmable microcontroller, breakout pins for attaching sensors, daisychain networking, and a continous rotation servo, with 360&#xBA; position sensing inside each Moti. It eliminates the need for external circuitry. \r\n\r\nWe also want Moti to play well with the web and mobile devices, so there&apos;s a RESTful API for developing apps.

            "description": "Project Bionic Yourself (B10N1C) is a small implant for your arm that makes you a bionic-superhero. The idea comes from utilizing technology to give you a super ability such as wireless control devices by moving a single finger, sense electromagnetic fields, and even scan RFID keys while all being stored inside your body. While these are a few examples, the possibilities range much further. It's also a user-integrated hacker tool that has the opportunity to change life as we know it.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the B10N1C is to explore the application of a small, safe, robust implant that communicates with the outside world through technology and the various user interfaces found in one’s day to day life.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project hinges on the idea of becoming bionically similar to Robocop. Using my knowledge of implantable materials (silicone, polyurethane, etc), I hope to upgrade my body to communicate with the tech-friendly culture that we live in today.",

Every designer who uses encryption in their design should be able to perform a side-channel attack, and understand the ramifications of these attacks on their designs. The open-source nature of the ChipWhisperer makes this possible, and my hope is that it becomes the start of a new era of hardware security research.",

This topic is still quite new and needs a lot of research.\r\n\r\nMost EMdrive builds work with frequencies around 2.4 GHz because a high power RF source for them can be made out of a microwave oven magnetron.\r\nMy attempt is is to build one which works with 24GHz, which reduces the form factor significantly and makes it possible to be used in small satellites.\r\nA so small EMdrive could be flown to space for  20000$ on a pocketqube satellite.\r\n",

It is potentially applicable to experiments with autonomous aircraft (or spacecraft) altitude-finding, SAR imaging/mapping or navigation as an alternative to (or in addition to) other sensing techniques such as GPS, ultrasonics, LIDAR or barometry, without some of the limitations applicable to those technologies.",
